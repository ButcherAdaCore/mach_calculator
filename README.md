--  From the user, an air temperature (T) is given. Before calculating the
--  speed of sound (Knots), the air temperature value must be converted to
--  Kelvin (K). The speed of sound is then converted to the corresponding
--  unit of the user provided measured air speed and the Mach value
--  calculated and returned.
